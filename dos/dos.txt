- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
Express.js will automatically interpret query parameters as string. While in the insecure version, the value passed by url 
is directly used as MongoDB qurey, where _id is supposed to a ObjectId type, and this will lead to the crash of MongoDB and the server is down.
The secure version simply guard this by using a try-catch block to prevent the crash of the server.
Availbility is compromised in this case.

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
We can do rate limiting to control the rate of incoming requests or actions performed by users or clients.
I can expose some sensitive services to only trusted users.
