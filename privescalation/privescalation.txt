- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
In the insecure version, any user can impersonate the admin and escalate his privilege. In the secure version,
the user is authenciated first and verify the user's id to make sure it is a legitimate operation. 

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
We can implement two factor authentication - session id and token.
We can expose sensitive access to only granted users, preventing other user to access the sensitive services.
