- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
In the insecure version, we have only a vulnerable log statement, and it has the high risk of repudiation.
In the secured version, we are using middleware to log user info of the http requests.
Every sent or received messages, we are logging them to better traceability.
Besides, for each error, we are also logging them for troubleshooting.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
We can add audit policies and monitor the logs periodically to find suspicious user
actions.
